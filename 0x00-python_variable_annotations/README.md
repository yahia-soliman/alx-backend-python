# Python - Variable Annotations

In Python 3, type annotations do not change the fact that it still a dynamically-typed language. Type annotations serve the following purpose:

- **Code documentation:** thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
- **Linting and validation:** code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
